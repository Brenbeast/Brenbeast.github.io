        Why is it so important?

      <p class="lead grey-text w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">
        Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the
        mid-20th century to the human expansion of the "greenhouse effect"1 â€”
        warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth
        toward space.
      </p>
      <p class="lead grey-text w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">
        Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived
        gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond
        physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as
        "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond
        physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as
        "feedbacks."
